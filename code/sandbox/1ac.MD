Good morning honorable judges and distinguished debaters. As the affirmative team, we believed the Taiwanese government should reinstate mandatory one-year military conscription.

I want to start by ranging the stakeholders. According to the "Act of Military Service System," males in Taiwan without disabilities or mental disorders who are eligible for physical examination Aged between 18~36 males should have the duty obligation to receive military service for one year. In addition, volunteering still exists.

Currently, we are facing these problems: 

## Contention 1: Military Internal Problems

### Military Strength

All soldiers should have patriotism if we want our army to be powerful. A report in the **Wall Street Journal on Oct. 2021 indicates** the problem in Taiwan is that the few soldiers and low morale are urgent problems.

#### Insufficiency of soldiers

Although volunteer service exists, our army needs more soldiers. In a 4-month service period, soldiers only receive training for three months, and roughly 25,000 people are in the military each time. Compared with those in Korea, 330,000 people each year, the number of soldiers in Taiwan is insufficient.

One reason is the low birth rate. According to the analysis of the Legislative Yuan (year?), there were about 153 thousand newborns last year, which is the sixth least in the world. Furthermore, the total number of soldiers will decline to 56 thousand in 2039.

#### The problems lying in current training

1. For mandotary soldiers, the time of training is not enough and short. According to..., ... .
2. Training plans is ineffective.
Even if we have enough soldiers, our army can only defend itself if we have enough appropriate training.
Even if we have enough soldiers, and  the training cannot match the real senorio.

### Actions speak louder than words

Patriotism should be turned into real action. 
Taiwan number 1 → prevent **crisis** & protect our home &rarr; take action → one of the ways is to join the army or being conscribed into the army → extending from 4 months to one year.

To solve this problem, extending the length of military service can increase our patriotism.

### National Defense (and awareness)

The national status is constantly changing. So we need to keep our arm force in a stable state. Moreover, According to the Constitution of ROC, every citizen must fight for their country.

## contention 2: Soft Power

Ｗe can consolidate our soft power. The economic status of Taiwan is vital and indispensable in the world. Take the economic aspect as an example. There is an essential microchips industry in Taiwan, such as TSMC. According to the slide in Earning Calls on Oct. 2022 of TSMC, the net revenue is increasing past two years. Furthermore, according to a report in Business Weekly, Taiwan offers 92% production of advanced microchips and semiconductors around the globe. Under various pressure from China, TSMC  has enormous global influence in Taiwan and can serve us with diplomatic and strategic value.

Once China invades Taiwan, according to the Silicon technology powering business in the UK, the most-advanced chip factory in the world would be rendered “not operable", which will impact not only Taiwan’s economic impact, but also the whole wide world. According to The World Bank, since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Ukraine’s economy is now projected to contract by 35% this year although economic activity is scarred by the destruction of productive capacity, damage to agricultural land, and reduced labor supply as more than 14 million people are estimated to have been displaced. According to recent World Bank estimates, recovery and reconstruction needs across social, productive, and infrastructure sectors total at least $349 billion, which is over 1.5 times the size of Ukraine’s pre-war economy in 2021. While global prices for oil, gas and coal have been rising since early 2021, they skyrocketed after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This crisis has implications for consumers and Governments alike – constraining fiscal affordability; firm productivity; and household welfare.

### Armed power
We can improve the strength of the military. According to the "Five-Year Force Reconstruction and Policy Plan Report,2022" of the Ministry of National Defense, the Taiwan government bought MQ-9 "Reaper" from the USA, which can stay in the air for a long time, monitor and detect all day and night, and also has the striking ability. The army, navy, and air force also set up five remote control drone defense systems in the critical barracks. The navy indicates that they had promoted six Kang Ding-class frigate systems to improve the capability to defend air and anti-missile.
Also, war is no longer a brute force in this age of technology. Learning to operate these devices, such as robots or fighter jets; or making strategic judgments, is not any less important than physical fitness. No matter your fitness level, there's a place for you in the military. You can contribute any area of your expertise to help the nation.

#### Increase budget
Budget is a very important part of military training and before the war happend, we need to increase our budget in order to improve our arm quaility. For example, 

#### Increase bonus
These days, young people who will serve in future prefer bonus than famous or praises. Increase bonus could make soldier more cheerful or willing to serve for government and country. 

#### Redisign Training System
Taiwan's training system is terrible, we should change our training way and improve our training quaility. In this addition, we could make our soldier more prepareful and stronger than the training system we using now.

#### physical and mental

Also, military service is not about making each person a soldier; it is excellent physical and mental training. Military service could help us increase our awareness of protecting our family and country. Also, military service makes soldiers braver, more confident, and more prepared.
